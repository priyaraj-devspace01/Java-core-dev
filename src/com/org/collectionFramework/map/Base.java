        Characteristics:
        Key-Value Pairs: Each entry in a Map consists of a key and a value.
        Unique Keys: No two entries can have the same key.
        One Value per Key: Each key maps to a single value.
        Order: Some implementations maintain insertion order (LinkedHashMap), natural order (TreeMap), or no order (HashMap).
